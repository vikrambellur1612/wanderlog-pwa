# API Troubleshooting Guide
## WanderLog PWA - Fixing Wikipedia API Issues

### 🐛 Issue: Wikipedia API 404 Errors

**Problem**: Wikipedia's REST API endpoints were returning 404 errors for attraction searches.

**Root Cause**: Wikipedia changed their API structure and the specific endpoint we were using (`/api/rest_v1/page/search/`) was either deprecated or had different requirements.

### ✅ Solution Implemented

#### 1. Multi-Endpoint Fallback System
Instead of relying on a single Wikipedia API endpoint, we now try multiple approaches:

- **Method 1**: Wikipedia Search API with JSONP support
- **Method 2**: Wikipedia REST API for page titles  
- **Method 3**: Wikipedia OpenSearch API
- **Method 4**: Attraction-type specific searches

#### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
- Graceful degradation when APIs fail
- Better user feedback with loading states
- Fallback to comprehensive static attraction data
- Detailed console logging for debugging

#### 3. Improved Static Data
- Expanded attractions database for major Indian cities
- Added specific data for Rajasthan cities (Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Udaipur)
- Better fallback attractions for unknown cities

### 🔧 Technical Changes

#### Updated Wikipedia API Implementation:
```javascript
// New multi-endpoint approach
async tryMultipleWikipediaEndpoints(place) {
  // Try Search API
  const searchUrl = `https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&list=search&srsearch=${query}&format=json&origin=*`;
  
  // Try REST API  
  const restUrl = `https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/title/${place.city}`;
  
  // Try OpenSearch API
  const opensearchUrl = `https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=opensearch&search=${place.city}&format=json&origin=*`;
}
```

#### Enhanced Error Recovery:
- All API failures now fall back to static attractions
- Users see loading indicators followed by results
- No more empty attraction lists

### 🎯 User Experience Improvements

#### Before Fix:
- ❌ Empty attraction lists when Wikipedia API failed
- ❌ Console errors visible to users
- ❌ No feedback during loading

#### After Fix:
- ✅ Always shows relevant attractions (dynamic or static)
- ✅ Smooth loading indicators
- ✅ Clear visual feedback about data sources
- ✅ Graceful fallback to local data

### 🌐 API Status Indicators

The app now shows users where attraction data comes from:

- **"Live Data"**: Successfully fetched from external APIs
- **"Custom"**: User-provided attraction lists  
- **No indicator**: Static database used (still reliable!)

### 🚀 Performance Benefits

1. **Faster Loading**: Multiple API calls run in parallel
2. **Better Reliability**: Fallback systems ensure data availability
3. **Reduced Errors**: Comprehensive error handling
4. **Smarter Caching**: Avoid redundant API calls

### 🔮 Future Improvements

1. **API Health Monitoring**: Track which APIs are working
2. **User Preferences**: Let users choose preferred data sources
3. **Offline Intelligence**: Cache successful API responses
4. **Community Data**: Allow users to contribute attraction data

### 📋 Testing Checklist

To verify the fixes work:

1. ✅ Create a new trip
2. ✅ Add places from different states (especially Rajasthan)
3. ✅ Check that attractions appear (even if APIs fail)
4. ✅ Verify loading indicators work properly
5. ✅ Confirm no console errors for normal operation

### 🛠️ API Configuration

Users can still enable external APIs by configuring `js/api-config.js`:

```javascript
const API_CONFIG = {
  wikipedia: {
    enabled: true  // Now more reliable with fallback endpoints
  },
  openTripMap: {
    enabled: true,  // Set to true with API key for best results
    apiKey: 'your-api-key'
  }
};
```

The app now works excellently even without external API keys, thanks to the enhanced static database and better error handling!
